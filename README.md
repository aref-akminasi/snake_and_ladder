## Background
I had the choice to work on a project to develop a program related to the minor Visual Design & Front-End Development at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The idea behind this project was that I wanted to build an application that would help me learn more Object oriented programming in JavaScript while building it. I worked on this project on my own ☕

## Thanks

I would like to thank Paul Kuijpers and Reyber Turgut who guided me through this project ☺️
